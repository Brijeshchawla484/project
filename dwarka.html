            is a Hindu temple dedicated to Krishna, who is worshiped here by the name Dwarkadhish, or 'King of Dwarka'.
             The temple is located at Dwarka city of Gujarat, India,

             Vajranabha, over the hari-griha (Krishna's residential place). 
             The original structure was destroyed by Mahmud Begada in 1472, and subsequently
              rebuilt in the 15th–16th century,</p></div>

        <p class="para2">As per Hindu legend, Dwarka was built on a piece of land by Krishna that was reclaimed from 
            the sea. Sage Durvasa once visited Krishna and his wife Rukmini. 
            The sage wished that the pair took him to their palace.
            The pair readily agreed and started walking with the sage to their palace. After some distance, 
            Rukmini got tired and she requested some water from Krishna. Krishna dug a mythical hole that brought in
             river Ganga to the place.
